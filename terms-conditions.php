            </p>
            <h6>Customization specifications</h6>
            <p>You agree and acknowledge that all files uploaded by You will be 300 DPI or vector format. The design
                should be sized accurately to the size of the exercise book You have selected (240 mm height X 180 mm
                width or 297 mm height X 210 mm width). The final design shall appear on the exercise book as it appears
                in the preview. You understand that printing can only be as good as the quality of the image uploaded.
                TBIL will not be responsible for poor quality printing due to poor quality of the upload.
            </p>
            <p>Below are all the specifications that the image uploaded will have to adhere to.
            </p>
            <li>Following are the variety of file formats for uploading designs that the Website supports:</li>
            <li class="insider_li">Bitmap Image (*.bmp)</li>
            <li class="insider_li">JPEG Image (*.jpg,*.jpeg)</li>
            <li class="insider_li">PNG Image (*.png)</li>
            <li>Bleed - The very edges of the document are called the bleed area. To prevent an unwanted white border
                from showing at the edge of your document, be sure to extend any background colours or design elements
                all the way to the edge.
            </li>
            <li>Trim Marks - Trim lines are the finished size of the document. The document is cut close to the trim
                line, but because of the mechanical tolerances involved in printing, the actual cut can happen anywhere
                between the bleeds and the safe margin. Therefore, it is important to keep your text and important
                images within the safe margin.
            </li>
            <li>Safe Area/Margins - The safe margins are borders that are definitely inside the place where the cut will
                take place. Please remember to keep all important information, like names, addresses, phone numbers or
                logos within the safe margin (at least .137” from the edge) to ensure that they aren’t cut off when your
                document is trimmed.
                s </li>
            <li>Aspect Ratio - The aspect ratio of your image can be determined by dividing the image’s width by its
                height. If your image’s aspect ratio is not equal to the aspect ratio of our documents, your image may
                appear stretched or distorted when it is scaled to fit.
            </li>
            <li>Resolution - Resolution refers to the number of dots per inch (dpi), or the amount of detail the image
                has. Most documents prepared for upload should be 300 dpi at 100% of the final print size. Higher
                resolution means a more detailed image, and also larger file and longer upload time.
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>You agree that TBIL are not responsible for any misspellings, errors, or issues in your art file.
